    To build the KVM on Win32 using the Makefile in this
directory, you must have MKS "sh", "find" and "zip" commands
in your path. Also in the PATH string the MKS "find" command
must come before the "find" command built into Win32 (e.g., c:\winnt\system32\find.exe). So make sure your PATH variable
contains something like:

     ...c:\mks\mksnt;...c:\winnt\system32

and *NOT* something like:

     ...c:\winnt\system32;...c:\mks\mksnt

The makefiles rely on specific features in the MKS find command
that are not available in the Windows find command.
Once MKS is in your path, simply type:

     gnumake
