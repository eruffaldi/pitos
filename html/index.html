<h2>Pit's OS Kindergarden</h2>
<p>This is a small introduction to start to write an OS so get ready to play with 
  bits, ports, registers going from system assembler up to Java. This project 
  is made of some basic programs that explain problems in OS writing and a library, 
  when the things become more complex. All the programs are built to be loaded 
  from a floppy disk during the bootstrap, so you need a tool to copy the floppy 
  image over the disk, in the distribution I've put setfloppy.pl that requires 
  Perl &amp; Windows NT. If you want to reduce the test time, try a pc virtualizer, 
  like VMWare or Bochs.</p>
<h4>Programs' Structure</h4>
<p>The basic idea of this project is to get your basic OS services directly from 
  the CPU and the Memory, so the programs load at boottime using a little (512 
  bytes) boot loader from the floppy disk; another approach is to use a MultiBoot 
  program like <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub">GRUB</a>, but i wanted 
  to make all the things from scratch. The other thing that I reject is the BIOS, 
  yes, I've tried to reduce at the minimum the usage of BIOS because of its oddness 
  and the required switch to V86 mode, the idea is to use the BIOS before the 
  switch to protected mode, e.g. for getting the memory layout directly from ACPI. 
</p>
<p>Most of examples are directly in protected mode so these are steps required 
  from the bootstrap:</p>
<ol>
  <li>the <b>BIOS</b> loads the first sector of the floppy (bootsector) at segment 
    07C0, implemented by <b>pmload</b></li>
  <li><b>pmload</b> loads the rest of the user program from the floppy and switches 
    to protected mode very simply, passing the control to the user protected mode 
    program at the symbol <b>_amain</b>. Usually this code is implemented by pmsetup#.</li>
  <li><b>pmsetup</b> adjust the protected mode data structures (mostly IDT and 
    TR), optionally initialize the pagin system and then leave the control to 
    the symbol <b>_cmain.</b> Here starts the user program of most examples.</li>
  <li>the user program, written in C or C++, can work directly with the system, 
    at ring 0 or use the kernel library to create tasks and interact easily with 
    some peripherals. Optionally you can use a Java Virtual Machine to make the 
    things more interesting.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Kernel Library</h4>
<p>The kernel library is a set of functions created to make the things a little 
  more interesting, basically it offers: </p>
<ul>
  <li>syscall system for user/system </li>
  <li>software interrupts (for POSIX signal implementation)</li>
  <li>tasking with very simple task scheduling, semaphores</li>
  <li>some debugging tools (message logging and cpu exception logging)</li>
  <li>timing services (using CMOS and the TSC register)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Documentation and Manuals</h4>
<p>A first <a href="Usage guide">usage.html</a></p>
<h4>Download</h4>
<p>Get <a href="pitos.zip">here</a> the distribution.</p>
<h4>Tools Requirements</h4>
<p>To build and use the provided programs you need these two tools: <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://nasm.2y.net">NASM</a>, a great assembler used for the real 
    mode part of the project</li>
  <li>A GNU compiler with make, <a href="http://www.delorie.com">DJGPP</a> is 
    enough</li>
</ul>
<h4>Hardware Requirements</h4>
<p>Any x86 is good, specifically the code is totally compatible with any 386 system 
  with the exception of the high precision timer, based over the Pentium instruction 
  RDTSC.</p>
