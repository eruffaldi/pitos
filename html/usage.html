<h2>Usage Guide</h2>
<p>Now start to use this simple os toolkit: you have two kind of processes, user 
  mode and kernel mode. So we should have two sets of api, the one called from 
  kernel mode and the one from user mode: the kernel api are called ki_XXX and 
  invoked through the syscall mechanism by the user mode processes. </p>
<p>When you program with this toolkit you have to define a cmain entry point: 
  it is in kernel mode, and should initialize the kernel, setup some processes 
  (user or kernel) and then let run the kernel. </p>
<p>The first and simplest example is this one:</p>
